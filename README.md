## Week 5 of the Headstarter Fellowship: AI Rate My Professor

In Week 5 of the Headstarter Fellowship, our team of four developed **AI Rate My Professor**, a pioneering AI-driven platform designed to enhance the way students evaluate professors. By harnessing the power of OpenAI, Pinecone, Material UI, and Next.js, we built a site that allows users to access and retrieve precise information from Rate My Professor. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application streamlines the search process, offering tailored insights to assist in crafting the perfect class schedule.

Our project seamlessly integrates advanced technology with education, offering a superior tool for planning your upcoming semester.
